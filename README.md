# Solar Power Generation Prediction
## Solar Power Generation Prediction, Personal Project,                   May 2021 â€“ Jul 2021
* Developed a model predicting solar power generation prediction using time series weather forecast data
* Used XGBoost, LightGBM, NeuralProphet, and 1-Dimensional-CNN (used 1D CNN as a final model)
* Developed an additional model predicting insolation and the amount of sunshine of the next day using forecast data to reduce error rate by 70%, achieving top 3% on leaderboard

## Details for code
* Additional feature prediction : Insolation_AmountOfSunshine_Prediction.ipynb
* Extracting data using api : get_forecast_data_api.ipynb
* Model training : training.ipynb
* Inference : test_inference.ipynb
